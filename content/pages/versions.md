I've been maintaining [hbish.com](https://hbish.com/) since 2009. It has gone through several iterations ever since
 the inception and my design philosophy has changed multiple times.

Here is a timeline of the changes in reverse order and a brief outline of the technology used.

- [v7 (2018 - now)](#v7-2018---now)
- [v5 & v6 (2014 - 2018)](#v5--v6-2014---2018)
- [v4 (2013 - 2014)](#v4-2013---2014)
- [v3 (2013 - 2013)](#v3-2013---2013)
- [v2 (2011 - 2012)](#v2-2011---2012)
- [v1 (2009 - 2011)](#v1-2009---2011)

### v7 (2018 - now)

</figure>

For v7, around the same time static website were getting popular I found [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

From a design perspective, its still relatively minimal but I added much more about me and my story. The aim for v7
 was for me to get back into writing and blogging.

### v5 & v6 (2014 - 2018)

<div style="display: inline-block">

	<img src="/media/hbish-v6.png" alt="Ben Shi's Website v6">
	<figcaption>Version 5 & 6 of hbish.com</figcaption>
</figure>

At the time of v5, I was a huge fan of minimalist design. The website was literally stripped bare, I removed all
 integration with third party services and ended up only having 2 color elements to drive the entire website, black and
  white. For a cms point of view, I stuck with Wordpress but I already start to look for an alternative.

From a design standpoint v6 was exactly the same as v5, however I made the transition over from Wordpress to
[Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) due to its speed and simplicity.

### v4 (2013 - 2014)

<div style="display: inline-block">
<figure class="float-right" >
	<img src="/media/hbish-v4.png" alt="Ben Shi's Website v4">
	<figcaption>Version 4 of hbish.com</figcaption>
</figure>

Around this time I discovered [Zurb Foundation](https://get.foundation/) and I immediately fell in love
 with how complete and polish the framework was.  I rebuilt the website in Foundation whilst keeping a lot of the
  integrations in place.

The cms of choice was Wordpress.

### v3 (2013 - 2013)

<div style="display: inline-block">

</figure>

I had another version of the website in 2013. Unfortunately Wayback Machine didn't capture it in its archives.

I'm have located the source code, but haven't been able to get a screenshots.

### v2 (2011 - 2012)

<div style="display: inline-block">
<figure class="float-right" >
	<img src="/media/hbish-v2.png" alt="Ben Shi's Website v2">
	<figcaption>Version 2 of hbish.com</figcaption>
</figure>

After a couple years of maintaining v1, I decided to move over to [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). Prior to this
 I had used Wordpress for some of the sites I was running at the time. Also [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  was becoming popular so I decided to give it a go.

I kept the integration with twitter, added last.fm and moved over to instagram.

</div>

### v1 (2009 - 2011)

<div style="display: inline-block">
<figure class="float-right" >
	<img src="/media/hbish-v1.png" alt="Ben Shi's Website v1">
	<figcaption>Version 1 of hbish.com</figcaption>
</figure>

This was my very first attempt at building hbish.com. I didn't know better and built it using plain html, css and
 javascript. It was a static website and no cms were used. The css framework used at the time was called BlueTrip (ah
  the memories).

Whilst the website was simple, I built some simple integrations with twitter and flickr to display the latest tweets
 and images.
