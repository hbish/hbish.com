I'm currently the Head of Engineering at
[GROW](https://www.growsuper.com/), where we aim to disrupt the
superannuation administration industry by providing administrators with
better user experience and access to more member data through the use of
distributed ledger technology and APIs.

I previously worked for
[Versent](https://versent.com.au),
[J.P Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/pages /jpmorgan),
[ACI Worldwide](https://www.aciworldwide.com/), and
[Distra](https://www.crunchbase.com/company/distra).

🧐 I love solving complex issues.

🧪 I value software quality, and I take testing seriously.

👨🏻‍🏫 I believe in taking the time to teach and mentor.

☕️ I drink a lot of coffee.

🍔 I love a messy burger and a good gin & tonic.

⛰ I enjoy the outdoors (but I don't go out enough).
