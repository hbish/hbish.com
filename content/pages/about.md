I'm currently the Head of Engineering at [GROW](https://www.growsuper.com/), where we aim to disrupt the superannuation administration industry by providing administrators with better user experience and access to more data through the use of distributed ledger technology and APIs.

I previously worked for [Versent](https://versent.com.au), [J.P Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/pages
/jpmorgan), [ACI Worldwide](https://www.aciworldwide.com/), and [Distra](https://www.crunchbase.com/company/distra).

🧐 I love solving complex issues.

🧪 I value software quality, and I take testing seriously.

👨🏻‍🏫 I believe in taking the time to teach and mentor.

☕️ I'm a coffee lover, will need at least 2 a day to keep me going.

🍔 I love a messy burger and a good gin & tonic.

⛰ I enjoy the outdoors (but I don't go out enough).
