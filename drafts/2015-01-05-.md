I remember back in university

> **Individuals and Interactions** over Processes and Tools
    
> **Working Software** over Comprehensive Documentation
    
> **Customer Collaboration** over Contract Negotiation, and
    
> **Responding to Change** over Following a Plan 

I suggest you all to have a read of &#8220;_Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)_&#8221; by [Dave Thomas][1] who discuss this in much more detail.
