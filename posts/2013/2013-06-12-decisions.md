The quote above from Sarah Dessen's Just Listen has resonated with me ever since I saw it. As I approached my graduation I saw myself making a very important choice, career wise. The decision was far from what I had originally imagined. I ultimately gave up a job offer I know I would thoroughly enjoy and opting in for a graduate position at a very reputable investment bank.

Now, I cannot say whether I have made the right decision. I think there is no point in speculating as to what "would have happened" or if I would be "better-off" with the other job offer. Thinking back I realised at the time something, somehow has tempted me into moving and all the noise and doubt has clouded why I made the choice in the first place.

That is... **to use the opportunity as a platform for change and diversify my experiences**.

Nearly a year down the track, the result of that very decision has brought me to where I am today. I learnt a great deal about the investment industry; I met a great bunch of talented people, many of which are graduates just like myself; I learnt about discipline and how to work as a professional; I pushed myself out of the comfort zone of being stuck in a dev heavy environment and really working towards being a well-rounded person.
